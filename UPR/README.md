### Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe pneumonia associated with hyperinflammation, which is commonly termed cytokine storm. This process involves the activation of the innate immune system after the recognition of viral patterns and the upregulation of cytokine expression. Additionally, the biosynthetic requirements of viral proliferation may cause stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and drive the unfolded protein response (UPR). The role of UPR in SARS-CoV-2 replication and the ensuing inflammatory response was investigated. In vivo mice and Syrian hamster models of SARS-CoV-2 infection showed activation of the Ire1α-Xbp1 arm of the UPR. Human lung epithelial cells showed the dependence of viral replication on the expression of UPR-target proteins branching on the IRE1α-XBP1 arm. Likewise, Spike (S) proteins from different variants of concern activated the IRE1α-XBP1 branch. Together, these findings show that the IRE1α-XBP1 system enhances viral replication and cytokine expression and may represent a potential therapeutic target in SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia.
